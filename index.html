    <h1>Find an Alpha to attend</h1>
    <p>Alpha is running across Canada. Search below for an Alpha being hosted in your neighbourhood. There’s no cost, no pressure, and no follow-up if you decide after the first session not to come back. Have questions? Contact each Alpha below for more information. We can’t wait to see you at Alpha!</p>
